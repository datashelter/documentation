# Delete a misconfigured service from snaper

You may have misconfigured a service and want to delete it from snaper (this change will also be reflected on your dashboard). To do so, you can use the `snaper delete` command:

```bash
snaper delete [files|db] --name <service_name>
```

For further information about this command, you can refer to the [delete command documentation](cli/usage/delete.md).
