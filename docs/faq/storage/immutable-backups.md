# Are my backups immutable?

Yes, Datashelter offers immutable backups to ensure that your data cannot be altered or deleted for a specified period. This feature protects your backups from ransomware attacks and accidental deletions, providing an additional layer of security for your critical data.

When you enable immutability on your backups, they are locked for a defined retention period, during which they cannot be modified or removed. This ensures that you have a reliable copy of your data that can be restored in case of data loss or corruption.
