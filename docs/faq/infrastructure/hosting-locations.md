# Where are my backups stored?

### Storage on Datashelter (default)

At Datashelter, the security, privacy, and reliability of your data are top priorities.
By default, backups are stored on **OVHcloud** infrastructure, which provides multiple availability zones across:

* France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· â€” Gravelines
* Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª â€” Frankfurt
* Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± â€” Warsaw
* United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ â€” London
* Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ â€” Beauharnois

This partnership with OVHcloud ensures storage that is secure, performant, and aligned with European requirements, while delivering high availability at a controlled cost.

### Use your own S3 bucket

Datashelter is fully compatible with the S3 protocol.
If you prefer, you can configure your own S3 bucket to store your backups.

This lets you:

* choose the physical location of your data (region, provider, on-prem, etc.);
* retain full control over the storage layer;
* integrate Datashelter with your cloud infrastructure or existing backup system.

By connecting your own S3 bucket, you retain total control over the location and management of your backupsâ€”while benefiting from the flexibility and security of the Datashelter platform.
