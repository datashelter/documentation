# Infrastructure details

Your files are exclusively stored in Europe on an S3-compatible storage (we currently rely on [OVH Object storage](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/public-cloud/object-storage/)).

Snaper performs client-side encryption on-the-fly using AES-256-GCM algorithm, so your data always remain secured 🔒.

**Datashelter does not have access to your encryption keys**
