# Introduction

Datashelter is a fully integrated backup solution designed to simplify the process of backing up your Linux servers. With just a few steps, you can protect your critical data by backing up your files and databases to an S3-compatible storage system.
Datashelter provides seamless setup, automated backup management, and powerful recovery featuresâ€”all while ensuring your data is encrypted, compressed, and deduplicated.

### Key Features

## How it works

Snaper is the command-line tool (CLI) that powers the backup process for Datashelter. Built in Golang, Snaper is a powerful, lightweight tool designed to perform backups efficiently and securely from the client side. It handles everything from file and database backup to compression, encryption, and storage transferâ€”all within a single, easy-to-use binary.

What makes Snaper different from traditional backup solutions is its incremental backup with file-level deduplication. Unlike tools like rsync that only back up changed or added files, Snaper uses index-based backup method.

In essence, Snaper provides storage-efficient, point-in-time restoration, ensuring that you can recover your data exactly as it was at any backup point.


### Where does Datashelter store your data
