# delete

:::note
**Snaper cannot delete any snapshots from remote storage.** It can only remove a backup from the list of backups (useful to repair mistyped commands).

Snapshot deletion can only be performed through lifecycle rules on the remote storage. Please [contact our support](/support) to learn more about this feature.
