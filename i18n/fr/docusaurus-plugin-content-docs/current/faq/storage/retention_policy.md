# Which retention policy should I choose?

It depends on your needs for data recovery and cost management.

- If you need to keep many recent versions for quick recovery, choose a policy that retains more recent backups.
- If you want to save on storage costs, consider a policy that gradually reduces the number of older versions.
- For a balance between recovery options and cost, a tiered retention policy is often a good choice.
- If you have regulatory requirements, ensure your chosen policy complies with those rules.
- Evaluate your data change frequency and recovery point objectives to select the most appropriate retention strategy.
